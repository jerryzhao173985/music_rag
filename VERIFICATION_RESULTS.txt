CRITICAL BUG VERIFICATION RESULTS
==================================

Bug #1: User Preference Storage Crash
File: music_rag/src/llm/query_enhancer.py:330-343
Status: CONFIRMED ✓
Issue: Line 332 uses setdefault() returning set, line 343 converts to list
       Second call tries list.update() which doesn't exist
Impact: AttributeError on second feedback event

Bug #2: Playlist Insight F-String Syntax Error  
File: music_rag/src/llm/result_explainer.py:288
Status: CONFIRMED ✓
Issue: {summary['avg_tempo']:.1f if summary['avg_tempo'] else 'N/A'}
       Format spec (.1f) cannot be mixed with conditional in f-string
Impact: ValueError whenever function is called

Bug #3: Missing get_stats() Method
Files: gradio_app.py:300, streamlit_app.py:77,84,251
Status: CONFIRMED ✓
Issue: Calls rag_system.get_stats() but MusicRAGSystem has no such method
       Only rag_system.db.get_stats() exists
Impact: AttributeError when viewing stats (masked by bare except in streamlit)

VERIFICATION METHOD:
- Checked actual source code at exact line numbers
- Confirmed method existence in cli.py (not found)
- Verified Python syntax rules for f-strings

All three critical bugs are REAL and need immediate fixing.
