```bash
docker-compose up -d
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 3. Production Deployment

#### Option A: AWS EC2
```bash
# Launch t3.medium instance
# Install Docker
# Clone repo and run docker-compose
```

#### Option B: Google Cloud Run
```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT/music-rag
gcloud run deploy music-rag --image gcr.io/PROJECT/music-rag
```

#### Option C: Kubernetes

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

```bash
# 1. Stop current deployment
docker-compose down

# 2. Rollback to previous image
docker-compose up -d music-rag:v0.0.9

# 3. Verify health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# 4. Notify team
# Send incident report
```

## Performance Targets

- **API Latency**: < 200ms (p95)
- **Uptime**: > 99.9%
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1%
- **Throughput**: 100 req/sec minimum

## Scaling Triggers

Scale up when:
- CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
- Memory > 80% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 500ms (p95)
- Queue depth > 100

## Success Criteria

✅ System is production-ready when:
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Security measures in place
- [x] Monitoring configured
- [x] Backup strategy active
- [x] Team trained on operations
